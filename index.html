<h1>About me</h1>
<p>My name is Tommy Parsons, and I am majoring in Software Engineering. I attended Hilton High School in Hilton, New York.
My favorite hobby is going bowling as I have been bowling since I was 7 years old. I have continued to pursue the sport
and now participates in the RIT Bowling club. I also like to play guitar in my pastime and have been playing for a few years.
